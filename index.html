<h1 id=Section2>The beginning</h1>
<p>
  On July 6th, 2020, the Developer Space server received its first member. At first, the server was simply named "DEV". This is backed up by the fact that the
   first message in the server is welcoming SickanK (one of the current managers) to a server called "DEV".<br><br>
  Other than Zame, the owner, and the new member SickanK, another person named Emphi joined the same day as SickanK. Emphi did not talk and eventually left. It is unknown how long Emphi remained a member before leaving.<br>
  One day later, current moderator BILL_PRO_786 (aka The Pea of Chicks) joined the server.
   Zame welcomes The Pea of Chicks (from now on referred to as TPoC) to the server. TPoC, however, did not respond.<br><br>
  One day later, another now active member joined, notmyrealname. Zame welcomes notmyrealname to the server as he did with TPoC, and he politely responded, mentioning that he got there
   through Zame's <a href=youtube.com>YouTube</a> comment advertising.<br><br>
