<h1 id=Section1>The beginning</h1>
<p>
  On July 6th, 2020, the Developer Space server received its first member. At first, the server was simply named "DEV". This is backed up by the fact that the
   first message in the server is welcoming SickanK (one of the current managers) to a server called "DEV".<br><br>
  Other than Zame, the owner, and the new member SickanK, another person named Emphi joined the same day as SickanK. Emphi did not talk and eventually left on the 19th of December 2020<br>
  One day later, current moderator BILL_PRO_786 (aka The Pea of Chicks) joined the server.
   Zame welcomes The Pea of Chicks (from now on referred to as TPoC) to the server. TPoC, however, did not respond.<br><br>
  One day later, another now active member joined, notmyrealname. Zame welcomes notmyrealname to the server as he did with TPoC, and he politely responded, mentioning that he got there
   through Zame's <a href=youtube.com>YouTube</a> comment advertising.<br><br>
   After a bunch of inactive users joined,

<h1 id=Section4>Developer Space 2021</h1>
<p>
  People looked on, hopeful for the future of their world. The hellish year 2020 was over, yet the pandemic was still thriving and ready to take more lives. Meanwhile, a bunch of
  on <a href=https://www.discord.com>Discord</a> were fucking around, some not even acknowledging the new year. Developer Space 2021 is now here.
</p>
<h2 id=Section4.1>random kid Minecraft Bedrock and computer specs</h2>
<p>
<a href=https://discord.com/channels/729692843529994311/729692843529994314/816275933966630953>On the 2nd of March 2021</a>, random kid, amay428, and parzival provoked an argument regarding
computer specs.

<br><br> random kid started the argument by posting an image of him playing popular <a href= https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/729692843529994314/816275550439997440/2021-03-02_15.46.56.png?width=705&height=397>MMORPG Hypixel Skyblock, boasting his sugar cane farm, 30 seconds of flight, and 3.2 million coins</a>.
amay428 comments that the screenshot resembles old Minecraft because of random kid's heavy use of mods in his client. random kid responds with "imagine not playing hypixel skyblock. ew, what a noob", to which amay428
responds "I'm a bedrock guy". Now, in case you don't know, random is a fucking 8 year old and found a way to make an argument out of that.

<br><br>random kid responds to amay428 by saying "L #java". parzival tells
 random to try playing ultramodded modpacks such as Enigmatica. At the same time, amay428 asks why random kid said "L" to him. random responds to parzival's proposal with "lmfao no thats for kids" and to amay428's
  question with "thats for babies". amay428 responds no, as parzival points out the irony in random's statement, as he says something is for kids, while making a childish "ur mother" joke in his status, "i do pornananan with ur mother".

  <br><br>amay428 questions random's age, pondering whether it truly is 19 years, random shooting back with "hmm sometimes i think of the number 1. it fits your age". random proceeds to assert his dominance over 1.16 Minecraft players, as he plays
   1.8 instead of <em>cringe</em> 1.16 by saying "also noobs only play 1.16 minecraft. pros play 1.8". parzival shoots back with "legends play 1.12.2", referencing the large amounts of mods made for that Minecraft version. amay428 says "Legends play Bedrock".
   random responds to both of them with "EW, casuals".

   <br><br>amay428 lists a lot of ways in which Bedrock is better than Java, in order: Bedrock is faster, it has more players, and it's cheaper. random absolutely <strong><em>roasts</em></strong> amay428, by saying
   bedrock is for losers who are poor and have stupid pcs and most of them do have stupid pcs so they play it. amay428 mentions that the $26 (which is the price of Java Edition in the US) is pretty expensive for people in othe countries. random lists some flaws
    with bedrock, one being it has a lot of bugs, is behind Java Edition in updates, and has less features. Me, the writer is too lazy to fact check so I'll assume these are true. After some insults against Bedrock Edition and Java Edition (such as that
    Java costs more and is slow, utilizing a bad language, and that Bedrock is slower than amay428's grandmother.) After some argument about Java Edition's performance, random, with his big brain, shows off
    <a href=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/729692843529994314/816278288993091584/2021-03-02_15.57.47.png?width=705&height=397>his FPS on Java Edition</a>.
